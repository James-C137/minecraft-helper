minecraft helper roadmap

idea dump:
secure against mouse input when moving items
faster detect inventory location
detect items on the go (opencv?)
golden apple support
crafting support
put keyboard listener onto different thread if possible
auto fisher
auto clicker (for farms)
auto bridge
auto mine + torch
hotbar swap

next step:
put every function into its own class in the root directory
    that means put inventoryManager into lib as well
start working on the autoFisher class
